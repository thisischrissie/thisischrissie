## Hi there 👋

### I'm a Full-Stack Developer career-switching from a coach within the fitness industry. It might be to do with my gym's server continually crashing that inspired the change.

- 🎉 Showcasing on GitHub: [MERN Full-Stack Application](https://github.com/thisischrissie/group7-CFG-Fullstack) - CFG Group Project Spring 2024
- 🌱 Currently doing a CFG +Masters bootcamp course on DevOps and Cloud Engineering, specialising in AWS, Docker and Kubernetes
- 💬 Languages/ Frameworks / Tools I like to use are JavaScript, SQL, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Postman, GitBash and GitHub ofc.
- 📫 How to reach me: My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christel-g-b4ab4122a/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a qualified coach in the Foundations of Rock Climbing, been climbing for 7 years, and I've built a motorhome out of a Ford Transit Custom 🚐💨
